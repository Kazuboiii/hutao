          <p>Hu Tao serves as the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, who is responsible for planning funerals and similar affairs, although she often goes on breaks during the weekends. Most of the time, she is shown to have a livelier and active side to her, often pulling pranks on other characters, but is serious regarding matters to her profession.In the early days of Hu Tao's management of the Parlor, she was questioned by the other undertakers because she was only thirteen at the time. Her leadership would be up to the highest Calibur and increasing prestige, satisfying the other undertakers within. This also led to the subject of funerals being less taboo within Liyue as well as how Hu Tao obtained her vision. She is also a "famous" local poet, often traveling around to accumulate materials and inspiration for her poetry.She describes herself as an "alley school dark poet" and is proficient in writing doggerel, with her works being so recognizable that children tend to recite them.</p>

        <h3>MY OPINION ON HER</h3>
        <p>As i have been playing her since march 2021, she has been my main DPS and has been my main since then.I absolutely adore her and really enjoy playing her.From her appearance, to her kit and her story lines, everything fits in soo perfectly. On the top of that, she has that cute attribute but dark humor and scary jokes, which cannot be missed.</p>
        <p>To sum it up, she is the best character i have ever owned in any games i've played and will continue playing her.</p>
